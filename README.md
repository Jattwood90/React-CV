# React-CV
CV site made using React JS. Here I learned how to build a React app using NPM, and editing the JSx commands.

I found the advantage of using React over the conventional way of building a website, was the ability to easily install modules, such as CSS animate (as used in this website), and the easy ability to additional containers, without editing the HTML everytime. For example my portfolio section can be easily added to by editing a JSON file, which is then looped through the the front-end. Creating this portfolio site made it clear to me why React is a popular web-development language today.
